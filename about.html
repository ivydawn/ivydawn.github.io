			<h2>Hi</h2>
			
			<p>Welcome to my porfolio website. My name is Ivy Dawn LaBossiere. I am a soon to be graduate from the graphic design program at algonquin college. Over the past 3 years of schooling I have had the priveledge of learning and exploring so many different things creatively. Graphic design has really opened up my eyes to a new perspective of the world around us. I love working with anything that involves creativity. My passion is painting and I love jobs that allow me to incorporate my art into them. Logo and package design are what excite me. I also feel as though I have learned so many useful skills from graphic design that I would have never imagined before starting this program.</p>

			<h2>WHY</h2>
			
			<p>I want to be a designer because art is my passion. Being a designer is a way to bring art to life in everyday things. Designing gives the oppurtunity to look at things in a different light and see the world creatively. I love that there are always new challenges and different tasks. I get restless and tired from repetiton so the constant evolving nature of graphic design keeps me intrigued.</p>
