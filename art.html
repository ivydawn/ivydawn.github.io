		<h1>Apple Gift Card</h1>
	<p>I wanted to make a gift card with an evelope that would stand out. Most gift cards come in a pretty envelope or case with the stores name on it. I thought that by making the package actually look like one of the products that the company sells it would have a novelty feel to it and really engage the consumer and grab their attention.</p>
	
		<h1>Ransom Letter</h1>
	<p>This collage was made to go in a magazine layout for an article that was about a ransom letter. The goal when creating this or the vision rathr that I had was to make it look like it was a bunch of different pieces that had been ripped up and glued together. I really wanted the collage to have a ransom letter feel to it. I was very happy with the results and like the piece on it's own as a poster.</p> 
	
		<h1>Pencil Drawing</h1>
	<p>This was done as a personal project for a christmas gift to my parents. It's a drawing of my grandmother and I from years ago. My grandmother was always well known and recognized for the red glasses that she always wore so I thought that was an important aspect of the picture to draw attention to. As well, I decided to make the red dress a focal point because of the christmas theme.</p>
	
		<h1>Beatles Acrylic Painting</h1>
	<p>Painting is my favorite hobby. This painting of the beatles was done as a personal project in the summer. I love to paint using only black paint with the white of the canvas. The black and white has such a simple yet intense image.</p> 
	
	
	<h1>JayZ Acrylic Painting</h1>
	<p>This was another personal project that I did. This was also done using only black acrylic paint with the white of the canvas.</p> 
	
	<h1>Pulp Fiction Acrylic Painting</h1>
	<p>This was another personal project that I did. This was also done using only black acrylic paint with the white of the canvas. I decided to break this painting up between to canvases but only put the tip of the gun on the second canvas. The blank black space on the canvas gives it more of a dramatic effect and helps to bring life to the painting.</p>

	<h1>Apple Gift Card Template</h1>
	<p>This was the template that I had created for the apple gift card packaging that I made. These templates are what I used to print out and construct the actual packaging. The final product of this is shown in the nect image.</p>
	
	<h1>Terminator DVD Cover</h1>
	<p>The goal of the project was to recreate a DVD cover. We were allowed to recast the movie that we chose if we wished to do so. I wanted to put a fun spin on a serious movie to make it humorous. I decided to recast the movie terminator. It was all done in photoshop and I was very pleased with the results of this project. </p>
	
	<h1>Tiffany Ad Campaign</h1>
	<p>I decided to create a different spin on the Tiffany Ad campaign so
that the originality of it would allow the design to stand out among others. I went for a comidic tone
and used humour to get the message accross to the consumers. While doing this, I had to keep in mind
the heritage and classic look of the brand. I was able to execute my idea in a way that still represented
the company and what they are built on.</p>
	
	<h1>Future Shop Mobile Website Mockup</h1>
	<p>We were asked to create a mobile website mockup for a company to show a single feature of the website. I chose to do future and to demonstrate how a client would go through the screens to find and purchase a gaming console. This mockup shows step by step the screens and where to click or scroll on them.</p>
	
	<h1>Graduation Album Cover Acrylic Painting</h1>
	<p>This acrylic painting was a personal project that was inspired by Kanye West's cover for his album graduation. The album cover is originally square and the canvases that I had were rectangular so I decided to stretch it out length wise and spread it across to canvases to give it a more dynamic effect visually.</p>
	
	<h1>Anorexia Infographic</h1>
	<p>We were asked to create an infographic on a topic of our choice. I wanted to illustrate something that would grab peoples attention as well as inform them. I think that I was able to illustrate this topic in a way that was shocking enough to drive the message home but still toned down enough for the public eye.</p>
